![Consensys Logo](./Images/consensys_logo.png)

### Overview and Origin
* ConsenSys Inc.
* Founded in 2014 by Joseph Lubin and Andrew Keys
* Lubin was one of the original founders of Ethereum and wanted to encourage the adoption and development of the platform.  
* ConsenSys was [originally](https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-quorum-consensys/) funded by their own Ethereum wealth, but have had a recent seed funding round ([$10M](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/consensus-systems/company_financials)) and a fundraise with JP Morgan when they merged Quorum into ConsenSys (total amount unknown).  

### Business Activities
* ConsenSys has been created to help blockchain companies solve issues around regulation, deployment, funding, etc. when developing and bringing to market a new product or service.  
* They are heavily invested in Ethereum and build active clients and products on the open source blockchain.
* Their main targeted customers are either established companies who need assistance implementing eterprise level development solutions (i.e.- blockchain consulting) or individuals who will be the end users of their "[Web3](https://learn.consensys.net/catalog/info/id:182)" products (MetaMask, Infura, Diligence, Codefi, etc.)
* The biggest advantage ConsenSys has is that they are uniquely positioned to be able to develop, fund and deliver a wide range of products and services to different classes of customers.  There are companies that invest in blockchain ([Panterra Capital, Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, etc.](https://www.block123.com/en/feature/top100-crypto-venture-capital-firms)) and there are companies that develop blockchain ([Bitfury, IBM, LeewayHertz, etc.](https://hackernoon.com/top-blockchain-development-companies-2019-rebi3zo8)), but very few that do both. ConsenSys has successfully merged those two domains together and continue to grow their umbrella of supported [companies/projects](https://labs.consensys.net/portfolio/).

### Landscape
* ConsenSys is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, but the best domains they fall under are Blockchain Development and Venture Capital, and in particular Ethereum and Ethereum based projects.
* The current blockchain space all started with Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin in [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin).  Since then, there have been new blockchain projects, forks of existing blockchains and an explosion of layer 2 solutions built on top of existing blockchains.  The biggest blockchain (aside from Bitcoin) to emerge from that period was Ethereum.  Ethereum is an open source protocol that utilizes blockchain and smart contracts to 
* Who are the other major players/competitors?

### Results
* What has been the impact of the company so far?
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in the domain use to measure success?  How is this company performing based on those metrics?
* How are they performing relative to competitors?

### Recommendations
* What products/services would you advise the company offer?
* why would offering thie product/service benefit the company?
* What technologies would this utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
