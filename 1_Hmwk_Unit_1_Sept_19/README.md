## FinTech Company Case Study

![Consensys Logo](./Images/consensys_logo.png)

### Overview and Origin
* ConsenSys Inc.
* Founded in 2014 by Joseph Lubin and Andrew Keys
* Lubin was one of the original founders of Ethereum and wanted to encourage the adoption and development of the platform.  
* ConsenSys was [originally](https://www.coinspeaker.com/jpmorgan-quorum-consensys/) funded by their own Ethereum wealth, but have had a recent seed funding round ([$10M](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/consensus-systems/company_financials)) and a fundraise with JP Morgan when they merged Quorum into ConsenSys (total amount unknown).  

### Business Activities
* ConsenSys has been created to help blockchain companies solve issues regarding regulation, deployment, funding, etc. when developing and bringing to market a new product or service.  
* They are heavily invested in Ethereum and build active clients and products on the open source blockchain.
* Their main targeted customers are either established companies who need assistance implementing eterprise level development solutions (i.e.- blockchain consulting) or individuals who will be the end users of their "[Web3](https://learn.consensys.net/catalog/info/id:182)" products (MetaMask, Infura, Diligence, Codefi, etc.)
* The biggest advantage ConsenSys has is that they are uniquely positioned to be able to develop, fund and deliver a wide range of products and services to different classes of customers.  There are companies that invest in blockchain ([Pantera Capital, Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, etc.](https://www.block123.com/en/feature/top100-crypto-venture-capital-firms)) and there are companies that develop blockchain ([Bitfury, IBM, LeewayHertz, etc.](https://hackernoon.com/top-blockchain-development-companies-2019-rebi3zo8)), but very few that do both. ConsenSys has successfully merged those two domains together and continues to grow their umbrella of supported [companies/projects](https://labs.consensys.net/portfolio/).

### Landscape
* ConsenSys is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, but the best domains they fall under are Blockchain Development and Venture Capital. In particular, developing and investing in Ethereum projects/companies.
* The current blockchain industry all started with Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin in [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin).  Since then, there have been new blockchain projects, forks of existing blockchains and an explosion of layer 2 solutions built on top of existing blockchains.  The biggest blockchain (aside from Bitcoin) to emerge from that development was Ethereum.  Ethereum is an open source protocol that utilizes blockchain and smart contracts to perform decentralized transactions. The appeal of Ethereum is that, at it's core, it is a protocol that allows decentralized apps (dApps) to be built on top of it. These dApps range in function from Cryptokitties to decentralized finacial (deFi) products.  DeFi is perhaps the most exciting genre of dApps to be developed as they allow for bankless transactions in roles that have, historically, required banks.  Some examples include lending/borrowing ([Compound](https://compound.finance/)), trading ([Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Kyber](https://kyberswap.com/limit_order/knc-weth)), stable coins ([USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc), [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/)), and decentralized bet making ([Augur 2.0](https://augur.net/)).  
* There are not currently any direct competitors to ConsenSys that integrate both a development and investment domain as ConsenSys has done.  However, you can look to the venture capital domain and the development domain, separately, to see who ConsenSys would be competing against in those respective domains:
    * **Venture Capital**:
        * _[Pantera Capital](https://www.panteracapital.com/about)_: founded in 2013 as the first US Bitcoin investment firm.  They are now focused on investing exclusively in blockchain technolgies. 
        * _Polychain Capital_: hedge fund that invests in blockchain projects and tokens.  
        * _[Coinbase Ventures](https://ventures.coinbase.com/)_: Coinbase is one of the most established crypto exchanges in the world and, in 2018, have begun to invest back into the industry they trade. Coinbase Ventures invests in early stage companies in order to spur development of the cyrpto ecosystem.
    * **Blockchain Development**:
        * _[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain)_: Perhaps the biggest name on this list, IBM is a staple in the technology field.  IBM has jumped into the blockchain fray and offers several blockchain services for the enterprise and supply chain level.
        * _[Bitfury](https://bitfury.com/)_: a software and hardware development company that focuses on developing blockchain solutions. They also happen to be one of the most successful Bitcoin ASIC mining producers in the world. 
        * _[LeewayHertz](https://www.leewayhertz.com/)_: A software development company that uses emerging technologies to solve their customer's issues.  From machine learning to robotic process automation to apps development, they cover just about all of it including blockchain development.


### Results
* What has been the impact of the company so far?
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in the domain use to measure success?  How is this company performing based on those metrics?
* How are they performing relative to competitors?

### Recommendations
* What products/services would you advise the company offer?
* why would offering thie product/service benefit the company?
* What technologies would this utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
